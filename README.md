<h1>I built this web page to practice my knowledges about some of the front-end technologies. This repository is gonna be improved according as my hard skills improve too.</h1><br>
<p>The idea of this project was based on a work from my school networking course.</p>
<p>The main idea of this project was learn a little about SQL database, but was my teacher that made the web site to the students see the result, so we just configured a simple database, nothin' else.</p>
<p>But in the end of last year I started to study about the main front-end technologies, and I had the idea to remake that project, but with the focus on learn HTML, CSS and JS, not in SQL database. So I used the localStorage tool to be my database on this project.</p>
